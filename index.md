## Career Objectives

I’m a finance student who’s worked at both a hedge fund and an AI green tech startup, giving me experience on both the investing and innovation sides. I’m heading into investment banking next year and am excited about the overlap between finance and technology. I’m also really interested in trading across different asset classes and seeing how markets react to big shifts and new ideas.

## Hobbies

Outside of work and school, I’m the president of my university’s pickleball club and love playing competitively at the collegiate level. I’m also really into chess and enjoy the mix of strategy and focus it takes. When I’m not doing that, you’ll probably find me watching movies or working out.
